OSFMount allows the analysis of disk images with PassMark OSForensics. OSFMount 
can be used to mount image files that were created using a disk cloning 
application (such as OSFClone). The image file is mounted as a virtual drive on 
Windows, which can then be analyzed using OSForensics.

OSFMount can also be used to create RAM disks and mount CD/DVD-ROMs as RAM disks.
